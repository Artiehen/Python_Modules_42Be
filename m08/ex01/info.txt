Create a data analysis program called loading.py that:
• Uses pandas for data manipulation
• Uses numpy for numerical computations
• Uses matplotlib for visualization
• Demonstrates the difference between pip and Poetry dependency management
• Includes proper dependency files for both approaches
Your program should analyze "Matrix data" (you can simulate this with sample data)
and generate a simple visualization.

Create both requirements.txt (for pip) and pyproject.toml (for Poetry)
• Your program must handle missing dependencies gracefully
• Include a comparison function that shows installed package versions
• Show the differences between pip and Poetry through your program’s output
