1. Summary 

You will implement a maze generator in Python that takes a configuration file, generates
a maze, possibly perfect (with a single path between entrance and exit), and writes it to a
file using a hexadecimal wall representation. You will also provide a visual representation
of the maze and organize your code so that the generation logic can be reused later.

2. Usage

Your program must be run with the following command:

python3 a_maze_ing.py config.txt

• a_maze_ing.py is your main program file. You must use this name.
• config.txt is the only argument. It is a plain text file that defines the maze
generation options. You can use a different filename.



3 Configuration file format
The configuration file must contain one ‘KEY=VALUE‘ pair per line.

Lines starting with # are comments and must be ignored.
The following keys are mandatory:

Key Description Example
WIDTH Maze width (number of cells) WIDTH=20
HEIGHT Maze height HEIGHT=15
ENTRY Entry coordinates (x,y) ENTRY=0,0
EXIT Exit coordinates (x,y) EXIT=19,14
OUTPUT_FILE Output filename OUTPUT_FILE=maze.txt
PERFECT Is the maze perfect? PERFECT=T

You may add additional keys (e.g., seed, algorithm, display mode) if useful.
A default configuration file must be available in your Git repository.

4 Maze Requirements
• The maze must be randomly generated, but reproducibility via a seed is required.
• Each cell of the maze has between 0 and 4 walls, at each cardinal point (North,
Est, South, West).
• The maze must be valid, meaning:
◦ Entry and exit exist and are different, inside the maze bounds.
◦ The structure ensures full connectivity and no isolated cells (except the ’42’
pattern, see below).
◦ As entry and exist are specific cells, there must be walls at the external borders.
◦ Your generated data must be coherent: each neighbouring cell must have the
same wall if any. E.g., it is forbidden to have a first cell with a wall on the
east side, and the second cell behind that wall without a wall on the west side.
• The maze can’t have large open areas. Corridors can’t be wider than 2 cells.
For example, you can have 2x3 or 3x2 open area, but never a 3x3 open area.
• When visually represented (see below), the maze must contain a visible “42” drawn
by several fully closed cells.
• If the PERFECT flag is activated, the maze must contain exactly one path between
the entry and the exit (i.e., it must be a perfect maze).

5. Output File Format

The maze must be written in the output file using one hexadecimal digit per cell, where
each digit encodes which walls are closed:
Bit Direction
0 (LSB) North
1 East
2 South
3 West

• A wall being closed sets the bit to 1, open means 0.
Example: 3 (binary 0011) means walls are open to the south and west. Or A
(binary 1010) means that east and west walls are closed.
• Cells are stored row by row, one row per line.
• After an empty line, the following 3 elements are inserted in the output file on 3
lines:
◦ the entry coordinates, the exit coordinates, and the shortest valid path from
entry to exit, using the four letters N , E , S , W .
• All lines end with a \n .

Your program must provide a way to display the maze visually, using either:
• Terminal ASCII rendering, or
• A graphical display using the MiniLibX (MLX) library.
The visual should clearly show walls, entry, exit, and the solution path.
User interactions must be available, at least for the following tasks:
• Re-generate a new maze and display it.
• Show/Hide a valid shortest path from the entrance to the exit.
• Change maze wall colours
